# Dynamite!

Simple JavaScript bot to play Dynamite, an enhanced version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, which includes the use of Dynamite and Water.

Very simplified strategy resulting in a bootcamp ruler bot ðŸ‘‘ !!

Test the bot locally using the console. To battle a bot, run the dynamite-cli.js file and give the relative file paths of the two bots of your choice, eg.   `node .\dynamite-cli.js .\myBot.js .\paperBot.js`.
